### Pendulum Simulation
``` This will be a pendulum simulation with up to 3 pendulums.```
* A pendulum is a mass hanging and swinging about, attached to an origin point. To calculate the motion of a pendulum you just need a couple values, the distance between the origin point and the object denoted by length, the mass of the object, and the angle made between the vector of gravity and the length. For a double pendulum, the origin point is the point of the first object. The second object uses the same variables as the first pendulum but are based on the location of the first object rather than the origin.
* First declare variables
